# Rap vs AI

## Built on the Microsoft Semantic Kernel open source framework

### What is Rap vs AI?

Rap vs AI is a sample app where you can rap battle against an AI. The app is built on the Microsoft Semantic Kernel open source framework. The Semantic Kernel is a framework that allows you to quickly build and prototype apps that use AI.

### How does it work?

Using the latest GPT models from OpenAI, the app generates a rap based on the input you provide. The app uses the Semantic Kernel to make the requests to the OpenAI API and to display the results. There are custom visual scripting nodes for Unity included in the package, for wiring up the Semantic Kernel for use within Unity. These provide examples for how to use the Semantic Kernel in your own apps or to add additional support for using the Semantic Kernel via visual scripting.
